# Fullstack Go HTMX App with Tailwind

This application is a fullstack Go application with HTMX and Tailwind CSS.

The application runs a Golang API which serves the HTMX frontend

I do use node but only for development purposes, I use Node and [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) to have `hot reloading` for the API and [browser-sync](https://browsersync.io/) for `hot refresh`

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have installed the following:

- [Go](https://go.dev/dl/)
- [Node + NPM](https://nodejs.org/en)

## Installation

Install NPM dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Application

After installing you can start the application by running the `run.sh` script. Use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
./run.sh
```

This will start the application. You should now be able to access it in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000` with hot reloading on code changes enabled.
